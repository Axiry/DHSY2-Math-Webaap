			 <h1>How do we factorise quadratic expressions?</h1>
  
      <h6>Well, I'm sure you have learned about quadratic expressions in your previous math lessons. Factorisation of a quadratic expressions simply means to take out the common factors in the expression and turn it into a factorised from(eg. x2 - 9x + 20 becomes (x - 4) (x - 5) after factorising). So how do we go about factorising the expression. Firstly,</h6>
    <ol>1) Identify the a, b and c in the expression. Typically, a quadratic expression will be in the general form, ax2+bx+c. For example, in x2+5x+6, a is 1, b is 5 and c is 6.</ol>
      <ol>2) Find two numbers that multiply to give ac (in other words a times c), and add to give b. So what we want is two numbers that multiply to make 6 and add up to make 5.</ol>
      <ol>3) 2 and 3 are suitable for this expression as they both add up to 5 and multiply together to give 6.</ol>
      <ol> 4) What we get from this is two pair of epxressions, namely (x+3) and (x+2).</ol>
      <ol> 5) Finally, we put these two brackets together to form (x+3)(x+2), so the final statement would be x2+5x+6=(x+3)(x+2).</ol>
